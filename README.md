# Banking System


## Description

A Java-based banking system built using Object-Oriented Programming principles, Swing GUI, and JDBC/MySQL. This project simulates core banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and transfers via a desktop application.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Account Management**  
  Create and manage multiple bank account types (e.g., Savings, Checking).

- **Transactions**  
  Perform secure deposit, withdrawal, and inter-account transfer operations.

- **User Authentication**  
  Simple login/logout screens for admin and/or customer access (customize as needed).

- **Account Activity Logs**  
  View transaction history with timestamps for each account.

- **Database Integration**  
  Uses MySQL for persistent data storage (accounts, balances, transactions).

- **Graphical User Interface**  
  Friendly desktop interface built with Swing.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Java SE (8 or above)  
- Swing for GUI  
- JDBC for database connectivity  
- MySQL (or compatible) database

## Setup MySQL Database

Create a database named banking_system.
Run the included SQL script (e.g., schema.sql) to create tables:

```bash
CREATE TABLE accounts (
  account_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  type VARCHAR(20),
  balance DECIMAL(15,2),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE transactions (
  txn_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  account_id INT,
  type VARCHAR(20),
  amount DECIMAL(15,2),
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (account_id) REFERENCES accounts(account_id)
);

```
##Configure Database Credentials

```bash
private static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/banking_system";
private static final String USER = "root";
private static final String PASS = "your_password";

```

##Build & Run

Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, Eclipse).
Ensure JDBC & MySQL connector libraries are in the classpath (e.g., via Maven/Gradle or manually).
Run the Main.java (or your app launcher class).
The Swing GUI window will open, allowing you to log in and perform banking operations.

## 📋 Usage

Login: Sign in as an admin or user (if implemented).
Create Account: Enter details for a new account (name, type, initial deposit).
Deposit/Withdraw: Choose an account and perform transactions using the GUI.
Transfer Funds: Move money from one account to another.
View History: Select an account to see its full transaction history.
